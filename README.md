## Task Log

***[Thursday, Nov 4, 2021]***

*11:45AM*

- Created the project
- Made the changes in Startup.cs
- One of the changes caused an error, UseSqlServer, there is a red line underneath and on hovering,
says that it cannot be found, I will try installing the SqlServer package later to see if that fixes the issue
- Created a git repository, linked it to github

*12:15PM*

- Installed the SqlServer Package
- After installing the package, I hovered over the error again and it displayed the same message,
but this time I had the option "Show Potential Fixes". I clicked that and clicked on the first fix
it recommended, "UseSqlServer" instead of "UseSqlServer", the red line is gone

*12:30PM*

- Got my style from bootswatch
- Made all necessary style changes in the project
- Successfully built/ran the project

*12:45PM*

- Linked additional stylesheets and scripts in _Layout.cshtml
- Added the dropdown menu to the nav
- Some of the code got cropped out so it wasnt working properly, but I googled
Dropdown Bootstrap and it had the rest of the properties/values
